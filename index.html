        <h2 id="caption"><u>Eren Yeager's Life Story</u></h2>
        <article>
            Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge of Wall Maria. He
            lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall, allowing a flood of
            Titans to invade and destroy the city.
            During the incident, Eren witnessed his mother being murdered and eaten by a smiling Titan. This event
            aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the
            earth. Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Jaeger, found him and gave him the key to his basement,
            instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria.
            He then injected Eren with a Titan injection. Two years later, Eren along with his two friends Mikasa
            Ackermann and Armin Arlelt joined the 104th Cadet Corps. The three successfully graduated, with Eren ranking
            as the 5th best cadet, and they joined the Scout Regiment following the struggle for Trost. After finding
            the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as
            well as the history of Eldia and Marley.
            Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the sea. Eren
            currently possesses the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding
            Titan. After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.

        <h3 id="history"><u>Another Eren Yeager's Life Story And Quote</u></h3>
        <article>
            Eren was born in Shiganshina District on March 30th, 835, in the southern region of Wall Maria to Carla
            Yeager and Grisha Yeager. He had a few friends, although his best friend was Armin Arlert, whom he often
            defended from the neighborhood bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing
            him a hidden book about the outside world.
            He dreamed of joining the Survey Corps as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside
            world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were frequently regarded as heretics and harassed constantly by
            other children.
            When Eren was nine years old he accompanied his father on a house call to the Ackerman family's house only
            to find both parents murdered and their daughter Mikasa missing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Yeager instructed
            Eren to stay within the house while he fetched the Military Police. Eren, however, tracked the robbers to a
            small cabin in the forest behind the house.
            <br><br>
            Thinking quickly, Eren feigned distress and claimed that he was lost. As one of the robbers approached Eren,
            he pulled out a hidden knife and stabbed the man. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged
            him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to
            death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on.
            As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by a third robber, who proceeded to strangle
            him. Eren urged Mikasa, who was frozen in fear, to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if
            she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their
            attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him.
            When Dr. Yeager eventually returned with the MPs, he took Eren aside, scolding him angrily for his reckless
            behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for
            killing the robbers. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and
            when Dr. Yeager invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation,
            tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.
